Switches after Aircraft loading:
 - 2-3 Switches and/or circuit breakers are switched to a different position (clumsy cleaning personel)

Failures during Operation
 -> If the MTBF in the Control Window is >0, various circuit breakers might flip during flight or on ground
  - ADF
  - Cockpit Lights
  - Transmisssion Indicator (will cause engine failure after 10min)
  - Fuel Pressure Indicator
  - GPS
  - Instrument Lights
  - SAS
  - ToT Indicator (no eng. failure yet, will come later)
  - VHF

Note: Turn Indicator and Transponder worked even if the BR was out, so I left them out of this

Height Velocity Diagram
  - Place the hv_diagram.ini in your aircraft folder
  - HV diagram following can be viewed in graphs part of the control window
  - Announcement on violation

---------------------------   Failure Detection   ---------------------------

Battery Draining (Batt on, Gen off)
 - Landing Lights on
 - Position Lights on
 - Engine Anti Ice on
 - Pitot Heat on
 - Cabin Heater on

Generator low rpm
 - below 65% N1 while Engine is ON

Startup Preconditions not met
 - Landing lights on
 - Engine Anti-Ice on
 - Pitot Heat on
 - Hydraulics off
 - Circuit Breakers not in
 - Generator on
 - TOT test switch not pressed before
 - Caution Lights test switch not pressed before
 - Cyclic not centered
 - Throttle not OFF

Starter early off
 - OFF below 55% N1

Starter late off
 - OFF above 65%

Circuit Breakers not IN
 - When engine is running or starter button is pressed

High Engine Wear
 - Rotor RPM < 88% and Torque > 35%

Cyclic not centered (on ground only)
 - On Ground and Rotor RPM between 20 and 90%

VRS Conditions
 - IAS < 30kt
 - VS < -300ft/min

Pitot Overheating
 - Outside Temperature > 4.4°C for 5min

Anti Ice Overheating
 - Outside Temperature > 4.4°C for 5min

Wind from Critical Direction:
 - Wind from between 50° and 210° from the aircraft perspective
 - Wind >=10 kt

Service Ceiling:
 - gross weight <= 1360kg: 20000ft alt
 - gross weight >1360kg: 13500ft density alt

Aircraft Overspeed:
 - 130kt
 - above 3000ft: -3.5kt per 1000ft density altitude
 - if torque > 85%: 80kt
 - if doors removed: 69kt (not checking for single doors, yet)

Engine Overspeed
 - >106% N1 for 0 seconds
 - >105% N1 for 5 seconds
-> Causes Engine Fire

Overtorque:
 - >85% for 5min 
 - >100% for 5 seconds
 - >110% for 0.1 seconds
-> Causes Engine Fire

ITT on ground:
 - >738°C for 5min
 - >810°C for 10s
 - >927 for 0.1s
-> Causes Engine Fire

ITT during flight:
 - >738°C for 5min
 - >810°C for 6s
 - >843 for 0.1s
-> Causes Engine Fire

Oil Pressure on ground:
 - >50psi for 5min
 - >70psi for 0.1s
-> Causes Engine Fire

Transmission Oil Pressure during flight:
 - >50psi for 5min
 - >70psi for 0.1s
 - <30psi for 10min
-> Causes Engine Fire (even if it is just the instrument -> watch it)

Transmission Oil Tempreature on ground:
 - >110°C for 5min
-> Causes Engine Fire

Transmission Oil Tempreature during flight:
 - >110°C for 5min
